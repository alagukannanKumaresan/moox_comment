TYPO3-Extension: MOOX Comment and Rating

#Bugs
First of all thanks a lot for amazing extension. All other extensions are too much buggy :)
Sorry I dont find a contact email. So I write here. 
only one bug is there, especially we could not able to find to add the linking page,

'where should new ratings be saved?'
This field is empty and required field.
Without this field entry, we cannot save this plugin and go further.

Please suggest me.
Thanks again :)
